# kwed

`kwed` (/kw…õd/) is a minimal [type-theoretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) proof assistant based on the [Calculus of Inductive Constructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_type).

`kwed` does not use tactics; all proofs are pure expressions not unlike in Agda.

for examples, see `examples/`
